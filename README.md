# SNAG
Spatial Navigation and Aging Project

This repository currently contains the R markdown for exploring the relationship between the different variables measured in the spatial navigation tasks. This includes visualizing distributions and correlations to assess whether there are significant associations between varaibles of interest.

Statistical analysis of varaibles by age and sex are computed in a separate markdown page that will be added when the paper is officially published, but the proof of the manuscript is available.
