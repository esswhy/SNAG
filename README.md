# SNAG: Spatial Navigation and Aging Project
## Age and sex differences in navigation behaviors between young and midlife adults

This repository currently contains the code and data for:

* Correlation Analysis
     + Exploring the relationship between the different variables measured in the spatial navigation tasks
     + This includes visualizing distributions and correlations to assess whether there are significant associations between variables of interest
* Behavioral Analysis
     + Analyzing participants by age and sex for each task
* Heatmaps
     + Plotting the x and y (z) coordinates of participants' data from the virtual desktop DSP task by age and sex groups
     + This visually computes the probability density of location(s) on the maze that participants frequently visited during the test phase
     + Collaborated on code with Chuanxiuyue "Carol" He
* Data visualizations
     + Jupyter Notebook containing code for boxplots from analyses

Proof and published manuscript are available for reading.
