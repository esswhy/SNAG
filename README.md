## Spatial Navigation and Aging Project

This repository currently contains the R markdown for:
* Correlations
     + Exploring the relationship between the different variables measured in the spatial navigation tasks
     + This includes visualizing distributions and correlations to assess whether there are significant associations between variables of interest
* Heatmaps
     + Plotting the x and y (z) coordinates of participants' data from the virtual desktop DSP task
     + This visually computes the probability density of location(s) on the maze that participants frequently visited during the test phase
     + Collaborated on code with Chuanxiuyue "Carol" He
* Behavioral analysis
     + Analyzing participants by age and sex for each task

Data files are confidential but available upon request for collaboration. Proof of the in press manuscript is available for reading.
